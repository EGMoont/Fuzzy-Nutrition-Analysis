# Fuzzy-Nutrition-Analysis

This repository contains a fuzzy logic-based system for analyzing nutritional data and predicting obesity indices. The system uses fuzzy logic principles to model various nutritional and lifestyle factors, providing insights and recommendations based on fuzzy rules.

## Project Overview

The project aims to apply fuzzy logic to nutritional analysis by creating a system that can predict obesity levels based on input variables such as age, height, weight, and dietary habits. The system employs fuzzy membership functions and fuzzy inference rules to evaluate and categorize the data.

## Key Features

- **Fuzzy Membership Functions**: Defined for variables such as Age, Height, Weight, and various dietary factors.
- **Fuzzy Rules**: Constructed based on expert recommendations and scientific literature to assess nutritional status and predict obesity levels.
- **Visualization**: Membership functions are plotted using Matplotlib to visualize the fuzzy sets and their degrees of membership.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Fuzzy-Nutrition-Analysis.git
   cd Fuzzy-Nutrition-Analysis
